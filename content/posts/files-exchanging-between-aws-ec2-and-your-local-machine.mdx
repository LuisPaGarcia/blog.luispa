# Copying files from local to EC2

## tl;dr
- We will use `scp`, this tool is Secure Copy or SCP is a means of securely transferring files between two machines on a network. SCP uses SSH for improved security and will prompt you if it needs a password or passphrase for authentication.
- You'll need the `scp` [tool](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/) and your `key_name.pem` file to make this.
- By using these two resources, you can define which files do you want to copy between your EC2 instance and your local machine.
- This is an alternative if you use Filezilla for the file exchanging.

## How to transfer files from your local machine to an EC2 instance

Run this script on your local machine

```sh
$ scp -i /path/to/your/key_name.pem /path/of/yout/local/file/to/copy server_username@ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:path/where/ to/save/the/file
```

## How to transfer files from an EC2 instance to your local machine

Run this script on your local machine.

```sh
$ scp -i /path/to/your/key_name.pem server_username@ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:path/where/the/file/exists /your/local/directory/to/save/the/file
```

### Final Notes
- Depending on the operative system, you should change the `server_username`. For an Ubuntu instance, you could use `ubuntu` or `root` user. 
- Make sure the user has to read permissions on the server directory.
- If you want to transfer all the files on a directory, use an asterisk `*` on the path where all the files exist. See the example below

```sh
$ scp -i /path/to/your/key_name.pem \
server_username@ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/* \
/your/local/directory/to/save/the/files
```

Happy coding!
