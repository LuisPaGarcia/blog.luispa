A few months ago, I deleted a file.

Today, I realized that actually, I need it! I picked a random commit 6 months ago and found the file… but hm, what if it changed after that point?

How do I find the \*final\* version of that file?

Here's the Git command I used:

```shell
$ git log --full-history -- src/path/to/file.js
```

This finds the commit that deleted the file. So, I checked out that commit, and then backed up one more:



```shell
$ git checkout HEAD~1
```

This loads the file right before it was deleted! 🎉

Git is such a powerful tool. One of these days I'll make an interactive tutorial for it.

H﻿appy hacking!
