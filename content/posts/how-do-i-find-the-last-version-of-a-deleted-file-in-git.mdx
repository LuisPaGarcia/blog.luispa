A few months ago, I deleted a file. 

Today, I realized that actually, I need it! I picked a random commit 6 months ago and found the fileâ€¦ but hm, what if it changed after that point? 

How do I find the \*final\* version of that file?  

Here's the Git command I used:

`ï»¿``sh
$ git log --full-history -- src/path/to/file.js
`ï»¿``

This finds the commit that deleted the file. So, I checked out that commit, and then backed up one more:

`ï»¿``sh
$ git checkout HEAD~1
`ï»¿``

This loads the file right before it was deleted! ðŸŽ‰

Git is such a powerful tool. One of these days I'll make an interactive tutorial for it.

Hï»¿appy hacking!
