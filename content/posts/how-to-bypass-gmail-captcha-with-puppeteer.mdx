I had an situation this week, I wanted to read and validate some data from a private Google Spreadsheet using Puppeteer. I found 2 problems:

1. I needed to log in with a custom email/password to have the access to the spreadsheet. A captcha appears if we use a "vanilla" implementation of the puppeteer app.
2. The spreadsheet was blocked, we have read-only permission. We can't click, read, modify or make any operation on the cells.

This seems pretty awful, don't you think?

This is how I could bypass the Gmail captcha login and could read the data like a charm:

## The Tools
We choose to use 3 extra packages aside puppeteer:
- puppeteer-extra
- puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
- puppeteer-extra-plugin-adblocker

So I used this `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "spreadsheet-checker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "an google spreadsheet reader",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "puppeteer": "^8.0.0",
    "puppeteer-extra": "^3.1.18",
    "puppeteer-extra-plugin-adblocker": "^2.11.11",
    "puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth": "^2.7.6"
  }
}

```
