I had an situation this week, I wanted to read and validate some data from a private Google Spreadsheet using Puppeteer. I found 2 problems:

1. I needed to log in with a custom email/password to have the access to the spreadsheet. A captcha appears if we use a "vanilla" implementation of the puppeteer app.
2. The spreadsheet was blocked, we have read-only permission. We can't click, read, modify or make any operation on the cells.

This seems pretty awful, don't you think?

This is how I could bypass the Gmail captcha login and could read the data like a charm:

## The Tools
We choose to use 3 extra packages aside puppeteer:
- puppeteer-extra
- puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
- puppeteer-extra-plugin-adblocker

So I used this `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "spreadsheet-checker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "an google spreadsheet reader",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "puppeteer": "^8.0.0",
    "puppeteer-extra": "^3.1.18",
    "puppeteer-extra-plugin-adblocker": "^2.11.11",
    "puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth": "^2.7.6"
  }
}
```

## The Script

To get access to the spreadsheet we need to login first, and then make the redirect to the spreadsheet. So the script will be like this:

```javascript

const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-extra");

// Add stealth plugin and use defaults (all tricks to hide puppeteer usage)
const StealthPlugin = require("puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth");
puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());

// Add adblocker plugin to block all ads and trackers (saves bandwidth)
const AdblockerPlugin = require("puppeteer-extra-plugin-adblocker");
puppeteer.use(AdblockerPlugin({ blockTrackers: true }));

function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
(async function () {
  // That's it, the rest is puppeteer usage as normal 
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: false
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let navigationPromise = page.waitForNavigation();

  await page.goto("https://accounts.google.com/");
  await navigationPromise;
  await page.waitForSelector('input[type="email"]');
  await page.type('input[type="email"]', process.env.email); // Email login
  await page.click("#identifierNext");

  await page.waitForSelector('input[type="password"]', { visible: true });
  await page.type('input[type="password"]', process.env.password); // Password login

  await page.waitForSelector("#passwordNext", { visible: true });
  await page.click("#passwordNext");
  navigationPromise = page.waitForNavigation();
  await navigationPromise;
  await page.goto(process.env.file_url); // Spreadsheet url

  await page.screenshot({ path: "spreadsheet-screen.png", fullPage: true }); // We take a screenshot to have probe of the bypass
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## The capture

So now we are in, how we can read the data? Well, the best approach with this scenario (read-only spreadsheet) we can download the data by using 2 things:

1. Using `page.keyboard.down` and `page.keyboard.press` to trigger the shortcuts to save the file in the format we want it (PDF, CSV, XLSX).
2. Setting the download folder handler for the puppeteer app.

## The shortcuts
In this case, I downloaded all the pages via HTML, using the next shortcuts.

`ALT + F` to open the `File` tab.
`ALT + D` to open the `Download` menu.
`ALT + W` to select `Website` option, and donwload all the content as HTML.
