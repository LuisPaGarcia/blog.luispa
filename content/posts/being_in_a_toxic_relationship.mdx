I was in a toxic relationship for years.

I eventually felt like I could not travel, meet friends, go to meetups or even think anymore. I was locked in, a prisoner.

It cost me my happiness, career opportunities, more friendships than I am willing to admit and years of my life. Worst of all, the other person made me feel like it was all my fault, that I brought it all upon myself and should be blaming myself.

It started after four years together with jealousy. Manipulations ranged from “You want to travel to a concert for four days instead of spending them with me? Don’t you love me?” and “You talked to a woman? Are you cheating on me?” to “You want to hang out with these people instead of me? Don’t you love me?”.

Gradually over many months and years these got worse and worse, and morphed into “You didn’t send me a message for five minutes, don’t you love me?” and so on.

This might sound absurd to people who have never been in a similar situation. “Why didn’t you just… go?!”

It’s because I thought she was everything I wanted in a partner, I had already invested too many love, time, money, and attention to a single person. That made me want to do everything I could to make her happy. When I fought her control or told her I was leaving, she resorted to emotional manipulation such as “I’m in the middle of college, you want me to drop college then?”, “I’m so sorry I will be better I promise you are the most important person in my life!”. Every time was the same thing, a week of calm and then only panic and pain.

Deep down I knew it wasn’t right, but she spent years making me feel like it was my fault, that I forced her to act that way with my actions, and that I couldn’t leave.

After years of unconditional support to finish college, 2 weeks ago I found out she was cheating on me with one of his friends since 2 months or so. Some day I'll write how I used an LLM to make the analysis of 20mb of text to find out this.

I can say that day I felt the most horrible non-physical pain I’ve ever felt until today. Packed my stuff, confronted her and his friend, and leave that day. 

I’m still dealing with the grief. One day at the time, I guess.

Ending that relationship is the hardest thing I have ever done. It took me years to recognize it was not “normal” stuff. It was also the best thing I have ever done. 

I’m still in pain, tbh. Being betrayed is horrible. At the same time I’m happy and grateful to be free again. I could not have done it without tons of support and love from my family and friends.

If you are reading this and find yourself in a similar situation, know that you are not alone. Many people have gone through it. It is not your fault and the other person is not your responsibility. 

I’d be happy to talk with you about my experience and offer any tips I can, [send me an email](mailto:ensayan.geiser0z@icloud.com) anytime.



Peace, nerds.
