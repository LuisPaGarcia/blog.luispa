> By default, when you create an screenshot is saved on the desktop. If you want it you can change it by running 1 like in the Terminal.

## Steps
1. Create the folder where you want to save all the screenshots.
2. Open the terminal
3. Run this command:
```bash
$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /PATH/TO/YOUR/DIRECTORY
```

Take in count you must change the script, and replace the path at the end with the location of your folder.

Once you run this, you can tes it by `Command` + `Shift` + 4, take an screenshot and test it.

Hope it helps! Happy coding!
