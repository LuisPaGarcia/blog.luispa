## tl;dr
- Github will charge you by execution time, so apply this feature will reduce your invoice.
- This is a very specific approach to run Cypress by demand, without the existing Cypress Action.
- The benefits of ovoid the `npm ci` step can speed up the action execution.

Most of the Github Actions I've created are Node.js apps, so the `npm install` is always part of the requirements. I found 2 ways to reduce the execution time by using the `actions/cache@v2` [cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache/). 
- The Cypress binaries are saved in the folder `~/.cache/Cypress` folder, so we need to cache it too.



1. Cache your `node_modules` and the `~/.cache/Cypress` folders

We can win time by using `npm ci` with a resolved dependency tree, by caching the `package-lock.json` context.






```yaml
name: CI

on: main


jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '12'

      - name: Cache Node Modules
        id: cache-node-modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: modules-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}

      - name: Cache Cypress Binary
        id: cache-cypress-binary
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/Cypress
          key: binary-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}

      - name: Install Dependencies
        if: steps.cache-node-modules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        run: npm ci



      # ... here all the things related to the job, like test script, lint or deploy
```

This will let you save the dependency install process time on every run.

For my project, I saved more than a minute on each run:





## Wrap up

The first solution is a better approach for most of the projects. The second one is faster (by far), I choose the second one. 

The cache will last 7 days in Github, just keep that in mind.

Now you have 2 approaches to reduce the time of your Github Actions.

So, let's reduce your Github invoice right now :D.

Happy coding!
