# Setting a Past Commit Date in Git and Pushing to GitHub

Sometimes, you might find yourself needing to set a commit to a past date, for example, to maintain consistency in your commit history or to trick you branch. Here's a guide on how to do this and push the commit to GitHub, ensuring the commit appears with the desired past date.

## Step 1: Configure Your Local Repository

Ensure you have a local Git repository set up. If not, clone your desired GitHub repository to your local machine.

## Step 2: Make Your Changes

Edit files and make the changes you want to commit.

## Step 3: Stage Your Changes

Use the `git add` command to stage your changes for commit:

```sh
$ git add .
```

## Step 4: Set the Commit Date

To set the commit date to a past date, such as January 14, 2024, you can use the `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` environment variable along with the `--date` option in the `git commit` command:

```sh
$ GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-01-14T12:00:00" git commit --date="2024-01-14T12:00:00" -m "Your commit message"
```

Replace `"2024-01-14T12:00:00"` with the exact date and time you wish to set, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`.

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

After committing with the specified date, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin main
```

Make sure to replace `main` with the correct branch name if different.

## Step 6: Verify on GitHub

Check your GitHub repository to ensure the commit reflects the correct date.

**Note:** Altering commit dates can lead to confusion, especially in collaborative projects. It's crucial to use this for appropriate scenarios and adhere to project guidelines regarding commit integrity.

Happy Hacking!
