> The official Go installation instructions is confusing, here's a quick tutorial on how I setup Go on a Mac environment using Oh My Zsh.

## Steps
1. Download Go
2. Configure the Environment
3. Validate the installation
4. Run a program to test

### 1. Download Go

The easiest way to do this is to install it using `brew`, [you can read more about brew here](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
$ brew install go
```

After the installation, you should be able to run this command and see an output that is not an error.

```shell
$ go version
go version go1.18.4 darwin/arm64
```

### 2. Configure the Environment

I like to keep all my Go projects in `$HOME/go` directory. Depending on your setup, add the following 2 env variables to your shell configs and define the desired paths:

First check your shell:
```shell
$ echo $SHELL
/usr/bin/zsh
```

Because I'm using ZSH, I'll add the 2 vars to the `$HOME/.zshrc` config file:

```shell
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

Reload the configuration:

```shell
source $HOME/.zshrc
```

### 3. Validate the installation

```shell
$ go version
go version go1.18.4 darwin/arm64

$ echo $GOPATH
/home/luispa/go

$ echo $PATH
usr/local/go/bin:/home/luispa/go/bin
```

### 4. Run a program to test

Let's create a directory with a testing program:

```shell
$ mkdir -p $HOME/go/src/hello
$ cd $HOME/go/src/hello
$ nano hello.go # or open the file using your favorite editor
```

Paste the following Hello's code into the `./hello.go` file:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### 4. Run a program to test

Run this script to create the `go.mod` file.

```shell
# Go to the go path
$ cd $GOPATH

# Go to the hello path
$ cd src/hello

# Create the `.mod` file
$ go mod init example.com/hello
go: creating new go.mod: module example.com/greetings
go: to add module requirements and sums:
	go mod tidy

# See the content of the directory
$ ls
go.mod  main.go

# See the content of the go.mod file
$ cat go.mod
module example.com/greetings

go 1.18
```

Then, run this to install your package.

```shell
# Install the package and generate the bin
$ go install

# Go to the directory `bin` to see the executable.
$ cd ../../bin

# See the content of the bin directory
$ ls
hello

# Run the binary
$ ./hello
Hello, World!
```
`hello` is your new generated program binary. You can now execute it from any directory because the `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your previously configured `$PATH`.

## Wrap up

You installed Go and fully setup its environment.

Happy coding!
