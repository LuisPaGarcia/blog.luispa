Sometimes you want to compare the execution time between two different implementations in your scripts, so to do this easily use the `time` built-in shell tool.

First you must know the path of your time shell tool.
```sh
$ which time
/usr/bin/time

```

If you use `time` directly could have some troubles.

```sh
$ time -f %e sleep 4
-f: command not found
real    0m0.071s
user    0m0.056s
sys     0m0.012s
```

Use the `which time` result to use it instead.

```sh
$ /usr/bin/time -f %e sleep 4
4.00
```

You'll get the result in seconds.

The structure must be like `/usr/bin/time -f %e YOUR SCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS HERE`
