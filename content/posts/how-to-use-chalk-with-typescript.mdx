T﻿his is the most easy way to solve the chalk usage in TS.

A﻿fter dealing with this issue for a couple of hours, I found the most accurate way to solve the usage of [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) in Typescript.

**S﻿ome context:** After the version 5 of Chalk it relies in more dependencies and configurations than before. So, to solve this I found this version:



S﻿tep 1: Install the latest 4.x version.

```shell
npm install chalk@4.1.2
```

S﻿tep 2: The Chalk dependency can be used with require or import syntax

```
// Using import in JS or TS
const chalk = require('chalk');
console.log(chalk.green('Hello world In Green!'));
```

```
// Using import in TS
import * as chalk from "chalk";
console.log(chalk.red("Hello world in Red!"));
```

```
// Using deconstruction import in TS
import { blue } from "chalk";
console.log(blue("Hello world in blue!"));
```

A﻿nd that's it, hope you enjoyed.

H﻿appy hacking!
