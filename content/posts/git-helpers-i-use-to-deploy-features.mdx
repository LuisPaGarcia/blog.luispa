Most of my repositories CI/CD are bound to a specific branch naming convention, for example, when a push is made to remote `qa_branch` this branch the CI/CD pipeline starts to deploy it to `QA` environment. 

To make this easier, my team created this way to copy the actual branch to a specific bonded branch. We use `qa_branch` and `stg_branch` branches bound to CI/CD tasks.

## The scripts

### git-qa file
```sh
#!/bin/sh

USAGE='[help]'
LONG_USAGE='git qa help
        print this long help message.
git qa
        push the current branch to qa environment.'

OPTIONS_SPEC=
. git-sh-setup


qa_push () {
  branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  if test "$branch" = "qa_branch" # Name of the binded branch
  then
    die "you need push to qa environment other branch"
  else
    git checkout qa_branch && git reset --hard ${branch} && git push origin qa_branch -f && git checkout ${branch}
  fi
}

case "$#" in
0)
	qa_push "$@" ;;
*)
	cmd="$1"
  shift
	case "$cmd" in
  help)
		git qa -h ;;
  *)
		usage ;;
	esac
esac
```

### git-stg file
```sh
#!/bin/sh

USAGE='[help]'
LONG_USAGE='git stg help
        print this long help message.
git stg
        push the current branch to stg environment.'

OPTIONS_SPEC=
. git-sh-setup


stg_push () {
  branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  if test "$branch" = "stg_branch" # Name of the binded branch
  then
    die "you need push to stg environment other branch"
  else
    git checkout stg_branch && git reset --hard ${branch} && git push origin stg_branch -f && git checkout ${branch}
  fi
}

case "$#" in
0)
	stg_push "$@" ;;
*)
	cmd="$1"
  shift
	case "$cmd" in
  help)
		git stg -h ;;
  *)
		usage ;;
	esac
esac
```


## Steps to get up running (On Linux or WSL)

1. Find your git executables folder using:

```sh
$ git --exec-path
/usr/lib/git-core
```

2. Copy the `git-qa` and `git-stg` files into this folder.

```sh
# for linux could require `sudo`
$ cp ./{git-qa,git-stg} $(git --exec-path)
```

3. Grant permissions to run these scripts. (`755` this mean anyone not user root,
   and not in group root, was not allowed to run it.)

```sh
$ cd $(git --exec-path) # Move to the /git-core folder
$ chmod 755 git-qa  # Could require `sudo`
$ chmod 755 git-stg # Could require `sudo`
```




## How to use it

### git qa

This helper reset the branch `qa_branch` with the actual branch, and force a
push to the remote.




```sh
$ git qa

Switched to branch 'qa_branch'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/qa_branch'.
HEAD is now at 8e3666be fix(core): Your last commit message
Everything up-to-date
Switched to branch 'your_current_branch'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/your_current_branch'.
```


### git stg

This helper reset the branch `stg_branch` with the actual branch, and force a
push to the remote.

```sh
$ git stg

Switched to branch 'stg_branch'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/stg_branch'.
HEAD is now at 8e3666be fix(core): Your last commit message
Everything up-to-date
Switched to branch 'your_current_branch'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/your_current_branch'.
```
